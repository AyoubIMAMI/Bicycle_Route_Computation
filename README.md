# Go_Biking

## Concept: The goal of the Letâ€™s Go Biking! project is to develop a small app to compute itineraries by reducing as much as possible the distance to cover by foot (by using bikes instead).

### **How to launch the project:**

*First* - Run activemq

*Then* - Run the self hosted RoutingServer and ProxyCach servers using the .exe

*Finally* - Run the Main java class from an IDE

### **How to use the project:**
The app will ask for your destination and departure addresses, respectively. After computing the best itinerary, it will simply writes to you the different itinerary steps from your departure to your arrival, precising the moments where you have to walk and where you can use a bike.
